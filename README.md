Purpose:
Safe-city is a project that ensures the safety of public and preservation of public-laws by using modern technology. 
Idea is to monitor the whole city through cameras and detect the crime/ delicate situations. It becomes very difficult for police-stations 
to handle protests, strikes, traffic blockages, crimes etc., at the same time. It becomes even more difficult if everything comes together.
If they are assisted through camera surveillance, their job would become really easy. They will receive notifications about any situation 
from Safe-city control room, and all they have to do is arrive at location and make the situation under control. On-road patrolling will 
just become an outdated thing. Similarly, recuse organizations like ambulance and fire stations will also be notified about any accident
or emergency. Public can also report any emergency, social or personal problems etc.


//
Features:
This project covers traffic monitoring and reporting, crime monitoring and reporting, emergency monitoring and reporting, vehicle 
tracking, person tracking, finding fastest route between two locations and much more. Now doing challans, outreaching public-law 
violations like traffic violation, crimes, dealing with traffic blockage, road accidents and many other emergencies have become way 
easy to deal with.
